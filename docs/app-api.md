# ðŸ“Ÿ API application

The technologies used by the generated API application are:

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - a modern, high-performance, web framework for building APIs with Python.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - the application uses it as a database to store chats, messages, and other data.
- [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) - a PostgreSQL extension for storing vector embeddings and running similarity search. (if it was enabled during the project generation)
- [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/) - an asynchronous SQL query builder and ORM for Python based on [SQLAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/).
- [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) - a lightweight database migration tool for usage with SQLAlchemy.
- [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) - a data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/) - a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

The following tools are used to maintain the code quality:

- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) - a testing framework for Python.
- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - a code formatter.
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) - a utility/library to sort imports alphabetically, and automatically separated into sections.
- [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) - a tool for style guide enforcement.
- [PyLint](https://www.pylint.org/) - a source code, bug, and quality checker.
- [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - a static type checker (if it was enabled during the project generation).

The code of the generated Backend API application is located either at the root of the generated project directory (if you chose to generate a [API only project](./project-api.md) without Web UI) or in the `apps/api/` directory (if you chose to generate [API + Web UI project](./project-api-web.md)).

To see the list of CLI commands that can be executed from the API application directory, please refer to the [API application CLI](./app-api-cli.md) documentation.

To get more details about the API application structure and its source code, please refer to the [API application code guide](./app-api-code-guide.md) documentation.
