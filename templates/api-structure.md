## üè∞ Application structure

The application consists of the following files and directories:

- [`.venv/`](./.venv) (_git ignored_) - the directory with the Python virtual environment automatically created by Poetry.
- [`{{ cookiecutter.__api_package_name }}/`](./{{ cookiecutter.__api_package_name }}) - the main directory with the application source code.
- [`migrations/`](./migrations) - the directory with the PostgreSQL database migrations generated by Alembic.
- [`run/`](./run) - the directory the containing the CLI commands for running the application locally and other scripts described above.
- [`.dockerignore`](.dockerignore) - the list of files and directories that should be ignored by Docker when building the image.
- [`.env`](.env) (_git ignored_) - the environment variables that are used by the application.
- [`.env.example`](.env.example) - the example of the environment variables file.
- [`.flake8`](.flake8) - the configuration file for Flake8.
- [`.pylintrc`](.pylintrc) - the configuration file for PyLint.
- [`alembic.ini`](alembic.ini) - the configuration file for Alembic.
- [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) - the `Dockerfile` for building the production-ready Docker image.
- [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) - the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) configuration file for the local development environment.
- [`docker-compose.sql`](docker-compose.sql) - the SQL initialization script for the local PostgreSQL database.
{%- if cookiecutter.auth == "keycloak" %}
- [`docker-compose.keycloak-realm.json`](docker-compose.keycloak-realm.json.yaml) - the JSON file with the Keycloak realm configuration for the local environment.
{%- endif %}
- [`gcp-service-account-key.json`](gcp-service-account-key.json) (_git ignored_) - the service account key file for GCP. It is needed and will be used by the application only if you have `LLM_PROVIDER=vertexai` in your `.env` file.
- [`gcp-service-account-key.json.example`](gcp-service-account-key.json.example) - the example of the service account key file for GCP.
{%- if cookiecutter.__monorepo %}
- [`package.json`](package.json) - the `package.json` file for the `{{ cookiecutter.npm }}` package manager, which is required because this application is a part of the {{ cookiecutter.npm }} workspace. It is also used by [Nx](https://nx.dev/) - the tool for monorepo development.
{%- endif %}
{%- if cookiecutter.pip == "poetry" %}
- [`poetry.lock`](poetry.lock) - the dependencies lock file generated by Poetry.
- [`poetry.toml`](poetry.toml) - the configuration file for Poetry CLI.
{%- endif %}
- [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) - the configuration file for the Python project. It contains the project metadata, list of dependencies, CLI tools configurations and other settings.
- [`README.md`](README.md) - this file with the documentation.
{%- if cookiecutter.auth == "local" %}
- [`users.yaml`](users.yaml) (_git ignored_) - the file containing a list of users that are used by the application and are allowed to log in. This file is used by the `LocalAuthenticator` class from the [`./{{ cookiecutter.__api_package_name }}/auth/local_authenticator.py`](./{{ cookiecutter.__api_package_name }}/auth/local_authenticator.py) module. It is needed and will be used by the application only if you have `AUTH_PROVIDER=local` in your `.env` file.
- [`users.yaml.example`](users.yaml.example) - the example file containing the list of users.
